### Project description:
Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. We have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans. 
### Goal of the project:
Develop a classification model that will pick the right mobile plan with the highest possible accuracy. The threshold for accuracy is 0.75.
